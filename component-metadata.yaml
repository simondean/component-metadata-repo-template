# An area is a grouping of 1 or more teams. Currently each team can only belong to 1 area, though this may change in the future.
#
# An area could be a company vertical or any other type of organizational unit. An area can be useful for viewing things like tech debt and fitness test
# failures for all the teams in the area.
#
# An area's id must be in kebab-case

      The `description` should be a short description of the area that is 1 to 3 sentences long. It frequently used in the Component Catalog to describe the
      area.

      The `notes` field can include more detailed information for the area. The notes are not shown in as many places in the Component Catalog as the
      description.

      The notes field also supports [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

# A component is any part of a technology stack/platform.  A component could a web frontend, mobile app, microservice, database server, database, queue

    tags:

    # `repo` specifies the code repo for the component. For software, this would be the repo containing the code. For infrastructure like database servers or
    # queue services, this would be the repo that contains the config/code for the infrastructure
    #
    # Currently, the repo field is mandatory. In the future it will probably become optional
    repo:
      # The URL needs to be the Git clone URL for the repo and not a UI URL for the repo

    # The responsibilities section is inspired by the concept of Class-responsibility-collaboration (CRC) cards
    # (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card) except in this case the section describes the responsibilities of a whole
    # component and not an individual code class.  The section is a way to describe the top-level features or responsibilities of a component and can be useful
    # for both people new to the component and as a refresher for people who are already very familiar with the component.

    # The `teams` section is optional. It details 1 or more teams that are related to the component. Typically a team listed here owns the component but you can
    # list teams that previously owned the component (using `type: previous`). You can also add `type: primary` to include the team that is the primary owner
    # of the component when more than one team is specified.
    #
    # The `description` field can also be used to provide context on how a team relates to the component.

    # 1. Dependencies between microservices
    # 2. A dependency from a mobile app to an API gateway
    # 3. A dependency from a microservice to a database or queue
    # 4. A dependency between a database and the database server that hosts it

    # The `techDebts` section is optional. It describes the tech debt for the component. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt for a description of
    # the concept of tech debt. In this context, tech debt is not limited to i) code/design decisions that introduce tech debt but ii) also when the passage of
    # time introduces tech debt. For example, when a codebase uses an up-to-date version of a third party library initially but over time the version is not
    # upgraded, creating mounting tech debt.
